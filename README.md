# Bitcoin Title Trends Analysis

This project explores and analyzes trends in Bitcoin-related article titles to uncover insights about market sentiment and potential correlations with Bitcoin price movements. The analysis is performed using Python and various data processing and visualization libraries.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze a dataset of Bitcoin article titles over a specific period. The analysis includes:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Importing the dataset and preparing it for analysis.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying key trends and patterns in the article titles.
- **Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the data to highlight trends and insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named `bitcoin_titles.csv`. The file contains the following columns:

- **Date**: The publication date of the article.
- **Title**: The title of the article.

## Project Structure

- **notebook**: Contains the Jupyter notebook (`august_bitcoin_commented.ipynb`) with the code for data analysis and visualization.
- **data**: Contains the dataset (`bitcoin_titles.csv`) used for the analysis.
